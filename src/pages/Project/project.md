This project basically trying to be a simpler, Gatsby alternative.

Main difference being that instead of using GraphQL and many more complexities to handle your data, you put everything in the state or in the component using the hyperapp API and vanilla javascript.


This site is just a demo to get the word out potentially some help and assistance.

The project is very early, it does not even have a name yet. Hypersite? Instasite? Dinglebop? Please help.



The project currently handle it's own routing, but once an official hyperapp router package for V2 is out, I would defenitivly prefer building on top of that if possible.
